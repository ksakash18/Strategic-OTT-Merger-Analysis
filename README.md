The comprehensive analysis of LioCinema and Jotstar's performance from January to November 2024 offers valuable insights that can inform strategic planning for the upcoming merger. While both platforms demonstrated growth and user engagement, they exhibit distinct patterns in user behavior, content preferences, and revenue generation.
1. User Growth & Reach
LioCinema has a significantly larger user base (183,000) compared to Jotstar (44,620), with both platforms showing peak growth in November. This indicates strong market momentum, particularly towards the end of the year, suggesting successful content and marketing strategies.
2. Content Strength & Preferences
Jotstar offers a broader content library in 10 languages and has a more diverse appeal, especially in English and Hindi films. LioCinema, on the other hand, attracts users with regional content like Telugu and Hindi films. Movies remain the most consumed content type across both platforms, reinforcing their dominance in viewer preference.
3. Demographics & Subscription Patterns
Jotstar’s core audience comprises Tier 1 city users, aged 25-34, with a preference for VIP subscriptions. In contrast, LioCinema attracts a younger (18-24), Tier 3 audience primarily on free subscriptions. These insights suggest that post-merger strategies should cater to both premium urban viewers and emerging rural digital consumers.
4. Engagement & Inactivity
Jotstar boasts an impressive 85% active user base with higher average watch times (117 hours), indicating strong engagement. Conversely, LioCinema struggles with a 55% active user rate and lower average watch time (25 hours). Inactivity was closely tied to low engagement across both platforms, highlighting the need for targeted re-engagement strategies.

LioCinema, despite its larger user base, generated only ₹19M and experienced a ₹0.96M loss due to downgrades. This gap underscores the importance of refining LioCinema’s pricing model and content value proposition.
